Lab1. 100 points. Introduction to AI. Implement the followng functions. Each function is 20 points All functions must be recursive. You can use any auxiliary fucntions you deemed necessary to implement the functions described in the assignment. DUE: Tuesday 27th at 1 pm Follow instructions for submission in the course web page. hard copy to me at the beginning of class. No late assignments will be accepted. Name the fucntions ass I have named them in the examples. THisis an individual assignment. Collaboration is not allowed.

1. Write a function, subset, that takes as input two lists (already sets), say L1 and L2, containing just atoms and returns t if L1 is a subset of L2, nil otherwise. (L1 is a subset of L2 if all atoms in L1 are members of L2).
(m-subset '(a b) '(k m l a)) = T
(m-subset '(k) '(m a)) = NIL
(m-subset '(m a) '(a k n m))=T

2. Write a function that deletes all occurences of a given atom ins a list of any structure. The structure of the list should remain the same except for deleting the atom.
(m-delete 'a '(a d c)) = (d c)
(m-delete 'a '((a h) d a)) = ( (h) d)
(m-delete 'a '(b c)) = (b c)

3. Write a function that takes as input two atoms, say atoms "A" and "B", and  a list of any structure, say L. The function inserts atom A immediately before any occurrences of the atom B
(m-insert 'h 'a '( l m n a)) = (l m n h a)
(m-insert 'd 'a '( a n (a (a)))) = (d a n (d a (d a)))
(m-insert 'k 'b '(b (b b) b)) = (k b (k b k b) k b))
(m-insert 'n 'j '(s (n n) ((s)))) = (s (n n) ((s)))
